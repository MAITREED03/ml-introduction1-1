    "a) Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. It encompasses various techniques, algorithms, and methodologies aimed at enabling computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and learning from experience. AI can be classified into two main categories: narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task, and general AI, which aims to exhibit human-like intelligence across a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "\n",

    "Unsupervised learning can be employed in anomaly detection by identifying patterns or outliers in data without the need for labeled examples. One common approach is clustering, where data points are grouped based on similarity. Anomalies are then identified as data points that do not belong to any cluster or are significantly distant from the centroids of clusters. Another method is density estimation, where the algorithm models the distribution of normal data points and flags instances that have low probability density as anomalies. Additionally, techniques like autoencoders can be utilized to reconstruct input data, with large reconstruction errors indicating potential anomalies. By leveraging these unsupervised learning techniques, anomaly detection systems can effectively identify deviations from normal behavior without the need for explicit labeling of anomalies.\n",
